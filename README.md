**_CellOMaps_: A Compact Representation for Robust Classification of Lung Adenocarcinoma Growth Patterns**

This repositry contains the code for the following manuscript: 


**Introduction**
Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a morphologically heterogeneous disease, characterized by five primary histological growth patterns. The classification of such patterns is crucial due to their direct relation to prognosis but the high subjectivity and observer variability pose a major challenge. Although several studies have developed machine learning methods for growth pattern classification, they either only report the predominant pattern per slide or lack proper evaluation.
We propose a generalizable machine learning pipeline capable of classifying lung tissue into one of the five patterns or as non-tumor. The proposed pipleline's strength lies in a novel compact _Cell Organization Maps (cellOMaps)_ representation that captures the cellular spatial patterns from Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) whole slide images (WSIs).
